title: Mice Protein Project Data
---

PHYS 3130, a Practical Data Science Methods course required a project in which I chose the infamous Mice Protein data use multiple times in the field of data science and AI/ML. The dataset contains measurements of various protein levels from the cerebral cortex of both typical (control) mice and a Down syndrome mouse model (Ts65Dn). This data offers 1080 samples—each sample capturing expression levels for 77 proteins—and enables the study of how genetic differences, along with behavioral training and drug treatment, influence learning and memory. I chose this data because of my fascination with human cognitive functionality and this data provided a good overview of a certain specific control variate associated with specific illnesses. Also, the data was appealing due to its multiple recordings of single mice nature.
The data is highly dimensional with 82 features for one run and with multiple runs for one mouse. The fact that these proteins span pathways known to be important for synaptic plasticity and memory means the dataset is well-suited for exploring how molecular networks underlie cognitive processes. I recommend the article by Higuera et al. (2015a) from my literature review in order to learn more about this topic in details.
